DAG - Djmoch's Automatic Generator
==================================

usage: %s [-hv] [-Dname=value ...] [-m intype:outtype:xform ...]
	in ... out

Dag copies file trees from the input directories to the output directory. Each -m flag specifies a transform, xform, to apply to files of intype to create files of outtype where both intype and outtype are file extensions. Each -D flag specifies a macro that will be passed into each transform (see Transforms section below).

Intent
------

Dag was created to overcome some of the shortcomings of make(1).

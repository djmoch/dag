DAG - Djmoch's Automatic Generator
==================================

The goal of dag(1) is to create a static site generator that's as
Unixy as possible without feeling hacked together. After compilation,
configuration happens entirely via the command line, and the intent
is for the building to be orchestrated with a tool like make(1).
The utility also outsources hard things to other tools, focusing
on tools available in any POSIX operating system.

- lowdown(1) is used to convert Markdown into HTML and roff_ms

- groff(1) is used to convert roff_ms into PDF

- m4(1) is used to process page headers, footers, and any other
  data built from a template

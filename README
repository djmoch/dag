DAG - Djmoch's Automatic Generator
==================================

usage: dag [-Vhv] [-f file]

Dag copies file trees from the input directories to the output
directory. Before reaching their destination, files are filtered
according to the rules declared in a file (default: Dagfile) in the
working directory.

usage: dagindex -Vh
	dagindex -A [-a author] [-c category] [-d description]
		[-p date_published] [-s slug] [-t title] [-u date_updated]
	dagindex -G -o fmt

Dagindex maintains a database of index entries and refers to the
database in order to create index files. Index files can be either
HTML for XML formatted (for a landing page and RSS feed, respectively).
In generate mode (-G), output files are sent to stdout.

Intent
------

Dag, though perhaps reminiscent of make(1), is designed as a more
targeted solution for generating static websites and the like.
